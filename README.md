To build a Streamlit app that estimates the carbon emission of a code execution based on time taken and CPU utilization, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Basic Concept
The carbon emissions of running code are usually calculated based on the following factors:

Time Taken: Longer execution times typically result in higher energy consumption.
CPU Utilization: Higher CPU utilization means more energy is being consumed.
Carbon Emission Factor: This is typically given in grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity used, and it can vary based on the energy mix (renewable vs fossil fuels) of the data center or country.
You can estimate energy consumption by considering the CPU utilization, power consumption of the machine, and time taken. Then, by applying a carbon emission factor, you can estimate the carbon footprint.

2. Required Libraries
Streamlit: To create the web app.
psutil: To measure CPU utilization.
time: To track execution time.
numpy: For some basic calculations.
You can install these libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit psutil numpy
3. Code Example for Streamlit App
python
Copy code
import streamlit as st
import psutil
import time
import numpy as np

# Function to estimate carbon emission
def estimate_carbon_emission(cpu_utilization, time_taken, emission_factor=0.0002):
    # Estimating energy consumption (in kWh) assuming a typical CPU power consumption of 100 watts
    # You can adjust this power value based on your machine's specs
    power_consumption_per_hour = 100 * (cpu_utilization / 100)  # in watts
    energy_consumed_kWh = (power_consumption_per_hour * (time_taken / 3600)) / 1000  # in kWh
    
    # Carbon emission in grams based on emission factor (default: 200g CO2/kWh)
    carbon_emission = energy_consumed_kWh * emission_factor * 1000  # in grams
    
    return carbon_emission

# Streamlit app UI
st.title("Carbon Emission Estimator for Code Execution")

# Input: CPU utilization and execution time
cpu_utilization = st.slider("Estimated CPU Utilization (%)", 0, 100, 50)
time_taken = st.slider("Execution Time (in seconds)", 1, 3600, 60)
emission_factor = st.slider("Carbon Emission Factor (g CO2/kWh)", 50, 500, 200)

# Start code execution simulation (or you can directly use real-time data from a code execution)
start_button = st.button("Start Simulation")

if start_button:
    st.write("Simulating Code Execution...")
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Simulating some CPU utilization
    time.sleep(time_taken)  # Replace this with real code execution
    
    end_time = time.time()
    elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
    
    # Estimate the carbon emission
    carbon_emission = estimate_carbon_emission(cpu_utilization, elapsed_time, emission_factor)
    
    st.write(f"Code Execution Time: {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds")
    st.write(f"Estimated Carbon Emission: {carbon_emission:.2f} grams of CO2")
4. Explanation of Key Sections
estimate_carbon_emission: This function calculates the carbon footprint based on the CPU utilization, execution time, and a given carbon emission factor. You can adjust this based on where the code is run (renewable or fossil-fuel energy grids).

CPU Utilization: This is taken from the user input via a slider in the app. In a real-world scenario, you could measure actual CPU utilization using psutil.

Time Taken: The user inputs or estimates the execution time of the code.

Carbon Emission Factor: This varies by region but typically ranges from 200 to 500 grams of CO2 per kWh, depending on energy sources.

5. How to Run
Save the above code to a Python file (e.g., carbon_emission_app.py).
Run the Streamlit app using:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run carbon_emission_app.py
6. Further Enhancements
Real-time monitoring: You can use psutil to monitor the real-time CPU utilization and memory usage of the code.
Machine-specific settings: Allow the user to input the specifications of their machine (e.g., CPU wattage, GPU usage).
Improved energy estimation: Instead of just CPU utilization, you could account for other factors like disk I/O or GPU utilization, especially for machine learning workloads.
Dynamic code execution: Instead of simulating code execution with sleep, you could dynamically run user-provided Python scripts and measure their CPU usage and time in real-time.
This should provide a solid starting point for building a carbon emission tracker for code execution using Streamlit!
